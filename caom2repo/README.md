caom2Repo provides a client to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on an observation in a collection in a repository. The client also provides a 'visitor' function which accepts a plugin. The 'visitory' function iterates the observations of a collection and updates them according to the algorithm of the plugin function.
